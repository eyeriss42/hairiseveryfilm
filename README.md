# Hair is everyfilm

Hair is everything.

We wish it wasn’t so we could actually think about something else occasionally. But it is. It’s the difference between a good day and a bad day. We’re meant to think that it’s a symbol of power, that it’s a symbol of fertility. Some people are exploited for it and it pays your f~~~ bills. 

Hair is everyfilm.
